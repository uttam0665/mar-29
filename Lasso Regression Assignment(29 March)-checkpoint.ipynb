    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Lasso regression is a linear regression model that uses regularization. Regularization is a technique that is used to prevent overfitting, which is a phenomenon that occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data.\n",
    "In Lasso regression, regularization is achieved by adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the L1 norm of the model coefficients. The L1 norm is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.\n",
    "This penalty term pushes some of the coefficients towards zero, which makes the model simpler and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "Other regression techniques, such as ridge regression, use the L2 norm of the model coefficients. The L2 norm is the sum of the squared values of the coefficients. \n",
    "This means that ridge regression does not shrink the coefficients as much as Lasso regression, and it is less likely to eliminate features from the model.   \n",

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso regression in feature selection is that it can automatically select the most important features in the model.\n",
    "This is because the L1 norm penalty term used in Lasso regression can shrink the coefficients of some features to zero, effectively eliminating them from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other feature selection methods, such as backward elimination, require you to manually select which features to remove from the model. \n",
    "This can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if you have a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression can also be used to select features that are correlated with each other.\n",
    "This is because the L1 norm penalty term does not penalize the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, but rather the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients squared. This means that Lasso regression is less likely to eliminate features that are correlated with each other, as the sum of their absolute values will be smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Lasso regression is a powerful tool for feature selection that can help you to build better machine learning models.\n",

    "The tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "->Alpha (λ): This is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term. A larger value of alpha will shrink the coefficients more, which can help to prevent overfitting but may also make the model less accurate.\n",
    "->Number of features: The number of features in the model can affect its performance. A larger number of features can make the model more complex and prone to overfitting. However, a smaller number of features may not be enough to capture the underlying relationship between the features and the target variable.\n",
    "->Scale of the features: The scale of the features can also affect the performance of the model. If the features are not scaled to the same range, the model may not perform well.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to use Lasso regression for non-linear regression problems:\n",

    "->Ensemble methods: This is a technique that combines multiple models to improve the performance of the overall model.\n",
